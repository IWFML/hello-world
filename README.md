# hello-world
This is my first repository when I ended my college life. I hope this can be a new-start on my road to program.

I have started getting touch with coding since my second year in my college. I started with C first as many people did at the first time. Due to my extremely high interest in programming, I didn't feel bored when I study how to code. I was excited when my first program ran successfully.

In my third year at the college, I need to partcipate some intership to assist my interview later in autumn. At that time, I started coding with others. Besides, the project we worked together is in real situation, which means the project would be used by a portion of people when it was to be accomplished. This mades me excited and the knowlege I get in touch with is totally different with what I have learned by myself.

However, when I got deeper in coding, what I found is the lack of my knowlege on the fundermantal level, which means the basic of the computer. I used to apply toolkits from others to help to solve the problems I encoutered in the project, but I didn't know how the toolkits were generated. In other words, I am long to have my toolkits now. I wanna have mine.

This is why I am here.
